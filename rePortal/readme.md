## Advanced movement

rePortal features Source-like movement mechanics, including bunnyhopping, airstrafing, speed-wall strafing and of course *rePortals*!

- Bunnyhop by repeatedly jumping (easier with scroll wheel)
- Airstrafe by holding A or D when in airborne and smoothly turn your mouse in the movement direction. DO NOT HOLD W
- Speed-wall strafe by aiming slightly away from a wall, holding the movement key towards the wall and bunnyhopping!
- *rePortal* by standing in a portal and replacing the opposite portal for a speed boost
